            <p align="justify"><span class="bodysubtitle">About Traditional Chinese Medicine &amp; Herbal Formulas:<br>
            </span>In eastern Asia, particularly in China, herbal therapies have been practiced and continually perfected over thousands of years. In contrast to the strategy of Western modern medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) focuses on strengthening the body through the correction of imbalances rather than attacking only the symptoms of a particular condition. In TCM, the same condition is also managed differently with different people according to their variations in constitution and specific symptoms. Therefore, TCM is highly customized for particular individuals and has great value in complementing modern interventions in a great number of settings. </p>
            <p align="justify">The practice of herbal therapies with TCM also differs markedly with <br>
  Western herbal practices. In the West, herbs are often used singly for certain conditions whereas with TCM, extensive formulas consisting of herbal combinations have been found to be much more effective. Essentially, the effect of certain herbs used in synergy has been found to be more powerful than the predicted sum effect of the individual herb components. </p>
            <p>The basis for Traditional Chinese Medicine relies heavily upon the concepts of Yin and Yang as well as the Five Elements - Earth, Metal, Water, Wood and Fire, and the importance of their balance. Although such monikers may seem to relate more to mysticism than science, these terms actually represent a very logical construct to guide the management of appropriate therapies. The value of this system is evidenced by thousands of years of empirical yet undeniable success in the treatment of a wide variety of medical conditions. </p>
            <p>Therefore, under the care of a trained physician knowledgeable in the use of TCM, harmony and balance may be restored to the body in many conditions that are difficult to manage with Western medicine. </p>
